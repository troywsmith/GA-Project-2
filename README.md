Routes - designed the HTTP route architecture

Schema & Seeds - when you are confident with your ERD, define its tables in SQL and put into a schema file. For easier testing, write a seed file as well to insert sample data to your DB.

Models - you now have a working, populated database. Write a model with methods that use pg-promise to perform CRUD on the DB
